# Goals/Outcomes ‚ú®

- To test knowledge of consuming APIs and handling responses
- Loading state and knowing where and how to make multiple API calls efficiently

&nbsp;

# Pre-requisites ‚úÖ

- Add your Spotify client ID & secret to `config.js`
  - Note. **Never add this type of config to version control. This would usually come from your build server.**

&nbsp;

# Requirements üìñ

- Fetch and display _Released This Week_ songs
  - Use the API path `new-releases`
- Fetch and display _Featured Playlists_
  - Use the API path `featured-playlists`
- Fetch and display _Browse_ genres
  - Use the API path `categories`
- Loading state/UI _(optional, current UX is already clean)_

&nbsp;

# Think about üí°

- Taking a look at the Spotify API documentation
- Do you resolve each API request one after the other or in parallel?
- Where do you make the API requests?
- How much logic do you offload out of the UI components?

&nbsp;

# What's Already Been Done üèÅ

- UI/UX for all elements, including previews (mobile responsive)

&nbsp;

# Screenshots üåÑ
